# Implement the Neophyte's Guide to Scala

This is an implementation of [Daniel's famous Guide to Scala](http://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html) (just to have something to play around with).

How to make it work ...

* install `git` and `sbt` with a/the package manager of your choice (e.g. `brew`
)
* clone the repo
* run `sbt runMain neophyte.part01.Part01` (or any other part you like)
